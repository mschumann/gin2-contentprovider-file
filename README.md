# File ContentProvider for iQser GIN Version 2
## Introduction
The intention of this project is to provide Content Provider plugins for common file repositories (like Filesystem, MS Sharepoint and other common DMS) for the iQser GIN Platform.

The iQser GIN (Global Information Network) Platform is an enterprise class, highly scalable semantic middleware, whose features incorporate data integration, analysis, process control and information retrieval including the semantic search.

The iQser GIN Platform is designed as an intermediate layer (semantic layer) between data sources (content providers) and applications (consumers). The semantic layer comprises the iQser core and several light-weight frameworks that allow the iQser GIN Platform to be integrated seamlessly into the existing IT infrastructure and adapted to the organization's own requirements.
